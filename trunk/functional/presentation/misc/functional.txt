- "state is the root of all evil"

- how to deal with state? 
  (bank account example) -> FP does it explicity
  - centralize code that changes

- FP in Rails? 
 - models -> no state: easier testing
 - controller: harder, but still possible
 - views: each is used to yield state, so it's ok to create blocks
 
FP book:

- elegance, more productive
- think different about problems
- better understanding of the program
- compositionality 

- exercises (with TDD)
 - quicksort
 - functionaly tree: weight, values, insert -> (talk about pattern-matching)
 - sudoku
 
 Blocks as higher-order functions (3)
====================================

If you want to convert a method to a block:

.. sourcecode:: ruby

  class Processor
    def strip_string(s)
      s.strip
    end
  end
  
  processor = Processor.new
  lines.map(&processor.method(:strip_string))
