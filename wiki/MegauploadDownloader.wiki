#summary Bash script to download files from Megaupload

= Introduction =

{{{megaupload-dl}}} downloads files from Megaupload (free download, no account required). It is a shell script (Bash), so you will need a UNIX-like operating system (GNU/Linux, BSD, OSX, Cygwin, ...).

This script is free-software licensed under the [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html GNU/GPL3].

= Dependencies =

You will need _bash_ (>= 3), _curl_, and _recode_ (optional). On a Debian-based distro this should suffice:

{{{
# apt-get install curl recode
}}}

= Download & Install ==

[http://tokland.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/filesharing/megaupload-dl.sh megaupload-dl.sh] ([http://code.google.com/p/tokland/source/browse/trunk/filesharing/megaupload-dl.sh details])

{{{
$ wget http://tokland.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/filesharing/megaupload-dl.sh
$ install megaupload-dl.sh /usr/local/bin/megaupload-dl
}}}

= Usage examples =

* Download a single file:
 
{{{
$ megaupload-dl http://megaupload.com/?d=710JVG89
03.Crazy Man Michael.mp3
}}}

* Download a password-protected file:
 
{{{
$ megaupload-dl -p somepassword http://megaupload.com/?d=110JVG89
}}}

* Check if a link is alive:
 
{{{
$ megaupload-dl -c http://megaupload.com/?d=110JVG89
$ test $? -eq 3 && echo "link is dead, for sure"
}}}

* Download a list of files:

{{{
$ xargs -d"\n" -n1 megaupload-dl < file_with_one_link_per_line.txt
}}}

= Build a safe queue downloader =

Download and install these three scripts: [http://tokland.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tools/worker.sh worker], [http://tokland.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tools/loop.sh loop] and [http://tokland.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/filesharing/megaupload-dl-batch.sh megaupload-dl-batch].

{{{
$ megaupload-dl-batch file_with_links.txt
}}}

How it works: {{{worker}}} comments out links in {{{file_with_links.txt}}} with _#_ (if successful) or _#error_ (if unsuccessful), while {{{loop}}} executes {{{worker}}} until it succeeds. This way all links in {{{file_with_links.txt}}} will be eventually downloaded or marked with a non-retryable error.

= Motivation =

The goal of this script is about programming: how to write a minimal shell script with modular, compact and clean code. If you feel the script does not fulfill this goal in any aspect, feel free to contact me.

If your only interest is how to automatic download from file-sharing sites you should check [http://code.google.com/p/plowshare/ plowshare], as it supports  lots of sites, and it's extremely configurable.
